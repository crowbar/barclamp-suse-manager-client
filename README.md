Welcome to a Barclamp for the Crowbar Framework project
=======================================================
### **This barclamp (master) moved to [crowbar-core](https://github.com/crowbar/crowbar-core)! This repo only accepts bugfixes for tex and older**!

The [Crowbar Framework](https://github.com/crowbar/crowbar) is currently maintained by [SUSE](http://www.suse.com/) as
an [OpenStack](http://openstack.org) installation framework but is prepared to be a much broader function tool. It was
originally developed by the [Dell CloudEdge Solutions Team](http://dell.com/openstack).

## Steps to setup

* Install SUSE Manager Server
* Inside SUSE Manager, create an activation key. The activation key will be used in the barclamp's WebUI.
* Download the `https://your-manager-server.example.com/pub/rhn-org-trusted-ssl-cert-*-*.noarch.rpm` file (check the version number) as `chef/cookbooks/suse-manager-client/files/default/ssl-cert.rpm` (in this barclamp's directory tree).
* Reinstalling the barclamp might be required in order for crowbar to take notice of the new file. Do this with: `/opt/dell/bin/barclamp_install.rb --rpm suse-manager-client`
* Now apply the barclamp from Crowbar's WebUI on selected nodes.
